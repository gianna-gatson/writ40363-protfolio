For my final project, I built an interactive The Office fan webpage that lets users pick their favorite character and instantly switch the whole theme of the site to match that person. I’ve been obsessed with The Office since I was 13, and it’s always been something my family and I bonded over. So when I was trying to think of a project idea, I ended up rambling about the show, and that’s literally when it clicked: why not just build something around the thing I love most? Once I had that idea, everything else came together pretty naturally.

Throughout the entire project I used ChatGPT-4, but not in a way where it built everything for me. It felt more like having someone to bounce ideas off of or someone who could explain something when I was stuck. And honestly, I got a lot better at prompting as I went. At the beginning, I would say things like “fix this” or “do this,” and obviously AI can’t read my mind. Later on, I learned to be super clear—mentioning exact functions, files, or behaviors I wanted. I realized pretty fast that AI only gives good answers when you give it good input, and you absolutely still need human oversight. Even when my prompts were clear, I always read through everything carefully before using it in my project.

AI helped me learn a ton of new skills that I don’t think I would’ve figured out on my own. For example, I learned how to make border shapes for my character photos, which made the site look way more fun and polished. I also learned how to create an interactive pie chart, and that ended up expanding my understanding of localStorage way beyond what I used it for in earlier projects. One of the biggest things AI helped me figure out was how to build more than one theme mode. That pushed my CSS skills a lot, and it let me turn my “meet the characters” idea into a whole theme-switching experience.

But probably the biggest learning moment came when AI explained Node.js and Express to me. I asked how they “worked in the browser,” and it broke everything down in a way that finally made sense. Understanding the difference between frontend and backend helped me see how my comments system could be so much more than just a localStorage feature. Because of that explanation, I ended up building a Node.js backend that lets comments load across multiple browsers, not just one device. I learned about routes, JSON, HTTP methods like GET and POST, and why each comment needs a unique id. It felt like a huge step forward compared to the beginning of the semester when backend stuff felt impossible.

Even though I used AI a lot, I didn’t feel misled by it. Part of that is because I stayed really clear and specific about what I wanted, and if something seemed off, I immediately followed up with a better prompt. AI gave me good starting points, but I was the one who had to rewrite things, stitch ideas together, and make all the features actually work with my code. A good example of this is the “meet the characters” section. AI suggested that basic idea, but I’m the one who turned each character into a theme button, created the color object, wrote the quotes, and added the quote pop-up. That part feels very “me,” and it made the site feel personal instead of generic.

If I had more time, I would’ve added a short video of my favorite Office moments curated by me because I think that would’ve made the site even more fun and nostalgic. But by the time I thought of it, I was already running out of time.
Overall, this project boosted my confidence a lot. I feel way more comfortable with JavaScript now, especially with asynchronous code and working with an actual backend. And I also learned how to use AI in a smart, helpful way instead of relying on it too much. I went into this project just as someone who loves The Office, and I’m leaving it feeling like someone who can actually build something meaningful and functional from scratch.
