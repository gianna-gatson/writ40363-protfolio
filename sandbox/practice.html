  <h2> About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a junior at TCU double majoring in DCDA as well as Stratgeic Communication. Originally I was a biology major if you can believe it. I always knew I wanted to do two things in my profesional carrer; work with lots of people and help people in any way I could. Becoming a doctor seemed like the best way to do that. I quickly learned that my heart was not in medicine, and decided to make the switch to Strat Comm and DCDA. I felt I could be a force of positivty in marketing spaces. Advocating for people of all different backgrounds, and doing so in a cretaive way.</p>
  <p>My parents had an interracial marriage. My mom is Mexican and my dad is white. My whole life I have always felt like I was split down the midddle. I loved seeing people in the media that were mixed just the way I was. I want to give people from all different cultures a chance to see themselves through advertisments and diffrent medias as well.</p>
