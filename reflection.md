Learning Curve: Describe your experience learning Git and GitHub. What surprised you about version control? What part was more/less difficult than expected?

Looking Forward: Based on your experience so far, what aspect of web development are you most curious about or nervous about learning next?
I want to know how to make the text/background of sections different colors. I feel like this is essential to making a coherent website.


Support and Resources: What's been most helpful for your learning so far (class discussions, hands-on practice, online resources, classmates)? What additional support might you need moving forward?
So far being in class and working together on the codes has helped me the most. I feel I will probably be scheduiling more office hours in the future if I find myself sturglling. An idea I had was is all the. students in the class has a GroupMe in which we can ask one another quetions we all have.
