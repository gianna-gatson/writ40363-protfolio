    <p>One day I hope to work for the Los Angeles Dodgers! This orginization has always been near and dear to my heart. Growing up only an hour 1/2 drive from the iconic Dodger Stadium, I saw my fair share of games. Even made it to the World Series in 2017 when we played the Huston Astros. When we lost to the Astros that year because of their cheating... My mom took me to go get my favorite cookie to make me feel better. The orginization does an amzing job of making their fans apart of the expirence.</p>

    <p>Now you may be wondering what any of this has to do with DCDA. Well I took on this major because I want to go into Sports Marketing. By being culturally aware and having data analytics skills, I am a better candiate when looking for jobs.</p>
